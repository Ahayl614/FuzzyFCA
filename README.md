#FuzzyFCA
Java library implementing fuzzy extension of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) algorithm to extract fuzzy lattice and association rules.

The implementation extends colibri-java library that implements FCA algorithm and is available here: https://code.google.com/p/colibri-java/



#Concept Analysis
Formal Concept Analysis is an algebraic theory for binary relations. Every binary relation induces a complete lattice of so-called concepts. Concept lattices is also known as Galois Lattices. The definite text book for concept analysis is:

Formal Concept Analysis : Mathematical Foundations by Bernhard Ganter, Rudolf Wille, C. Franzke Springer, 1998.

The fuzzy extension of FCA to which the implementation is inspired is described in [1].
